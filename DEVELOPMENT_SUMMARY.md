# Mobile Plan Finder - Development Summary

## Project Overview
The Mobile Plan Finder is an AI-powered web application that helps users find the most suitable mobile plans based on their requirements. The application uses Google's Gemini API to analyze user requirements and provide personalized recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Package Management**: npm

## Key Features
1. Natural language requirement input
2. AI-powered plan recommendations
3. Detailed plan comparisons
4. Personalized explanations
5. Responsive design

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Development
- Created basic HTML structure
- Implemented responsive CSS design
- Added user input form
- Integrated direct Gemini API calls

### Phase 2: Security Enhancement
- Identified security issue with exposed API key
- Created serverless function architecture
- Implemented environment variable for API key
- Updated frontend to use serverless endpoints

### Phase 3: API Optimization
- Improved error handling
- Added loading states
- Implemented proper response parsing
- Enhanced user feedback

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. API Key Security
**Challenge**: API key was exposed in frontend code
**Solution**: 
- Created serverless function architecture
- Moved API calls to backend
- Implemented environment variables
- Added proper error handling

### 2. Response Processing
**Challenge**: Complex response parsing from Gemini API
**Solution**:
