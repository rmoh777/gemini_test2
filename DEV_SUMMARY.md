# Mobile Plan Finder - Development Summary

## Project Overview
This project is a single-page, production-ready mobile plan recommendation website. It uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API to analyze user requirements and recommend the best mobile plans from a hardcoded list. The site is fully responsive, modern, and deployable as a static site (originally intended for GitHub Pages, but also works on Vercel or similar hosts).

---

## Tech Stack Overview
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5 (single `index.html` file)
  - CSS3 (inline, mobile-first, CSS Grid/Flexbox, custom properties)
  - JavaScript (vanilla, inline, no frameworks)
- **AI Integration:**
  - Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API (REST, client-side fetch)
- **Data:**
  - 20 hardcoded mobile plan objects (major US carriers + budget)
- **Deployment:**
  - Designed for static hosting (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

---

## Key Features
- User enters requirements (textarea, 500 char limit)
- Gemini API analyzes and recommends 3 plans (ranked Best, Great, Good)
- Each plan card includes:
  - Carrier, plan name, price, features, hotspot
  - Simple, friendly explanation of why it fits
- Summary section explains why these plans were chosen
- Responsive, accessible, modern UI (Boost Mobile inspired, blue theme)
- "Start Over" button refreshes the page for a new search
- API key is hardcoded (for demo; not secure for production)

## Gemini API Integration & Debugging Journey
1. **Initial Integration:**
   - Used Gemini API v1beta endpoint and `gemini-pro` model.
   - Encountered errors: model not found, invalid endpoint, and response parsing issues.
2. **Fixes Applied:**
   - Updated endpoint to `v1/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent`.
   - Adjusted request body to match Gemini's REST API requirements.
   - Improved error handling and response parsing for plan IDs.
   - Added a second API call for plan explanations and summary, with prompt engineering for simple, user-friendly language.
   - Ensured the API key is used securely (hardcoded for demo, but not visible in UI).
3. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Added loading, error, and retry states.
   - Improved plan card layout, ranking badges, and summary placement.
   - Made the site mobile-first and visually compact.
4. **Deployment Issues:**
   - GitHub Pages had stuck builds; workaround was to deploy on Vercel.

## Integration Guide for Other Developers
- **Copy `index.html` and `.nojekyll`** to your new project.
- Update the hardcoded plans as needed for your use case.
- Replace the Gemini API key with your own (or move to a backend for security).
- Adjust the UI theme/colors as desired.
- Deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).
- For production, move the Gemini API call to a backend to keep the key secret.
